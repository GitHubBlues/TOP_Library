# **Library** 

This is a simple database-type application for displaying books (title, author, pages and reading status). It has functionality for displaying book items, adding items, toggling between "read" and "not-read" status and a function searching for books by title. 

The objective of this project was to gain practice in creating, editing and manipulating objects. Besides this, the project relies heaviliy on DOM manipulation implemented using several buttons. Furthermore, the branch uses_Classes replaces the object constructor with a class.
